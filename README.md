# Dylan's Portfolio Site

Made using NextJS and React. 

Originally I used the experimental /app folder, but I had to downgrade back to the standard version due to export limitations. 

/data folder holds objects used to populate page elements and provide links.
/pages contains all the pages. Routes are determined by the folder paths.
/styles contains .css files
/components contains React components that are used throughout the site
/public folder is for files such as images and documents that can be viewed by users
